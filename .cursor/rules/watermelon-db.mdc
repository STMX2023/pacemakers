In the Pacer app, the WatermelonDB setup is organized in a centralized and accessible location within the directory structure. Specifically, it resides in the `src/database/` directory. This placement ensures that all database-related components—such as initialization, schema, models, and synchronization logic—are grouped together, making them easy to manage and maintain while keeping them separate from other concerns like UI screens or API integrations.

Here’s a breakdown of what goes inside the `src/database/` directory:

- **`database.ts`**: This file handles the initialization of the WatermelonDB instance, setting up the database configuration for the app.
- **`schema.ts`**: This defines the structure of the database tables, ensuring consistency between the local database and the data models.
- **`models/`**: A subdirectory containing class definitions (e.g., `User`, `Group`) that represent the database tables and manage data operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting records.
- **`sync.ts`**: This file contains the logic for synchronizing the local WatermelonDB with the remote Supabase database, ensuring data consistency across the app.

This setup integrates smoothly with the rest of the app. The database instance is typically made available throughout the app by wrapping the root layout (e.g., `src/app/_layout.tsx`) with a WatermelonDB provider, such as a React Context. This allows components and custom hooks (likely located in `src/hooks/`) to access the database easily. Additionally, the `src/repositories/watermelon/` directory contains implementations for querying the local database, while the `src/services/sync.service.ts` orchestrates the synchronization process, potentially using API calls defined in `src/api/sync.ts`.

This organization follows best practices for a React Native app using Expo Router, providing a clean separation of concerns and supporting an offline-first approach where the app reads from the local database and syncs with the server as needed. Therefore, the WatermelonDB setup goes in the `src/database/` directory.
